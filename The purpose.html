<b><center><p>You should pick fast food over healthy food. If you want a nice big burger go to In N Out or any fast food restaurant. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO EAT SALAD OVER BURGERS. You want vegetables? Well burgers has lettuce and other vegetables! Itâ€™s not just only on burgers!<p></center></br>
<center><b>*Spaghetti has tomato sauce.</br></center>
<center><b>*French fries are made from fresh potatoes.</br></center>
<center><b>*Tacos has fresh vegetables and handmade tortas which are by flour.</br></center>
<center><b>Any fast food would fill up someone stomach while some homemade would probably not fill you up.</br></center>
<p>After when you're done looking at my website i want you to think  and crave that fast food is better than healthy food.</p></center>
